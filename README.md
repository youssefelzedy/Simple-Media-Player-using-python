# Simple Media Player using Python
Simple Media Player using python language

## 1. In the beginning, you must download all these libraries used in the program in order for it to work with you correctly.
`tkinter`
`pygame`
`librosa`
`numpy`
`soundfile`
`matplotlib.pyplot`
`tkinter`
## 2. This program is a simple explanation of how a simple music player works, and you can modify and develop it.
You can take the code, modify it, and develop the program as you like, but if you copy the code, you must mention in the reference that you only took this code from me.
## 3. A simple overview of the form of the application.

## 4. Program properties.
4.1. White noise generation.
The program offers a white noise feature that can create a distorted and blurred sound effect, like the sound of rain. While this feature can be useful for creating a relaxing atmosphere or for masking distracting sounds in the environment, it may also make it difficult to hear voices or distinguish strange sounds in the background. As such, users should be aware of this effect and use it judiciously. Overall, the white noise feature provides an additional level of customization for users, but it should be used appropriately to avoid any negative impact on the audio playback.

4.2. Expansion and Compression audio.
This program offers the ability to compress and expand audio, allowing users to modify the sound characteristics from a thin or compact sound to a larger or more spacious sound, and vice versa. This feature can be particularly useful for music producers or sound engineers who want to adjust the tonal balance and dynamic range of their audio recordings. With this tool, users can fine-tune the sound to their liking. Overall, the audio compression and expansion feature are a powerful tool that can help users achieve their desired sound output.

4.3. Increase or Decrease the speed audio.
This program provides professional-level functionality to increase or decrease the audio speed, with a range of speed options from x0.5 to x2. This feature can be useful for a variety of applications, such as adjusting the tempo of music recordings, slowing down speech for language learning or transcription, or speeding up narration for time-lapse videos. The ability to fine-tune the audio speed can also help users save time when listening to longer audio recordings, by increasing the playback speed without sacrificing intelligibility. Overall, the audio speed control feature is a versatile tool that can be customized to meet the specific needs of users.

4.4. Full control of the audio.
This program provides comprehensive sound control, enabling users to stop and start playback, adjust volume, and navigate seamlessly between audio files via a user-friendly list interface. With these features, users can tailor their listening experience to their liking, effortlessly managing their media library with ease. The program's intuitive design facilitates ease of use, allowing users to access and customize their audio content with minimal effort. Overall, this program offers a powerful set of sound control tools that are both flexible and accessible, enhancing the overall user experience.

4.5. Reverse audio.
A reverse function in a media player audio allows users to play the audio content in reverse, essentially reversing the playback direction. While implementing a reverse function can be technically challenging, especially for real-time audio playback, I'll outline a high-level approach to achieving this functionality:
1.	Audio Processing: Reverse playback involves manipulating the audio data to reverse the playback direction. To achieve this, you'll need to process the audio samples in reverse order.
2.	Audio Buffering: To facilitate reverse playback, you'll need to buffer a certain portion of the audio data to ensure smooth and uninterrupted playback. The size of the buffer will depend on the specific requirements of your media player.

4.6 Skip audio.
A skip function in a media player audio allows users to quickly jump forward or backward within a track or playlist. It provides convenience and flexibility for users to navigate through the audio content. Here's how you can implement a skip function in a media player:
1.	Determine the Skip Duration: Decide on the duration of each skip. It could be a fixed value, such as 10 seconds, or you can provide options for users to choose from, like 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 30 seconds.
2.	Design User Interface Controls: Create user interface controls that enable users to initiate the skip function. This can be done through buttons, icons, or gestures. For example, you can have dedicated skip forward and skip backward buttons or use swipe gestures on the playback screen.
